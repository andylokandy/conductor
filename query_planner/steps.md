1. Identify Subgraphs: The schema provides @join__graph directives for identifying two subgraphs: LOCATIONS and REVIEWS. You would need to connect to these subgraphs at their respective endpoints, http://localhost:4001/graphql and http://localhost:4002/graphql.

2. Identify Services: From the @join__type directives, you can infer that both LOCATIONS and REVIEWS services provide data for the Location and Query types. The Review type is provided by the LOCATIONS service.

3. Analyze Relationships: The @join__field directive helps identify the relationships between types and services. For example, the Location type has the id, rating, and reviews fields that are resolved from the LOCATIONS service, while name, description, and photo fields come from the REVIEWS service.

4. Plan Your Query: When executing a query, determine which fields are requested and map those fields to the respective subgraph. For instance, if a query requests information about a location and its reviews, you would need to send sub-queries to both LOCATIONS and REVIEWS subgraphs.

5. Resolve Query: Execute the query against each subgraph, combine the results, and return the combined result to the client.

6. Handle Data Merging: The @join__type directive can be used to handle merging data from multiple subgraphs. If the key value matches, the data from multiple subgraphs can be merged into a single coherent object.
