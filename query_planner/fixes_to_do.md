Nested _entities Queries:
    it looks odd, but it certainly is a big performance advantage, I just have to modify it to account for multiple "representations" arguments in the same query.

Use of __typename:
    Including __typename is very useful in type merging, but. However, its use here, especially in the nested context, might be redundant.

Inaccurate __typename in _entities Fragments:
    The __typename values in the _entities fragments are off. For example, inside the ... on User fragment, you should not have another ... on User fragment when requesting product. It should be ... on Product instead. This kind of nesting indicates there's an inconsistency in the way the query plan was generated.

Arguments for _entities:
    The arguments: None for the _entities queries isn't quite right. These queries require the representations argument, which typically comes from the results of the previous step in the plan.

Redundancy in Product Fields:
    Fields like upc are mentioned multiple times in the nested _entities queries. This is redundant and not typical of a well-formed query, it should identify that and retrieve it only once.
